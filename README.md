# Building Energy Standards Data
This repository hosts a database of building energy standards data for building energy simulation. Data includes tabulatable prescriptive building energy code requirements (e.g., minimum equipment efficiency, or requirement opaque surface thermal performance, or lighting power density allowance per space types) and other space type related assumptions necessary to building energy models. Additional documentation including how to build and query the database is provided in the [here](.\docs). **This is currently a work in progress.**
